CodeBook for Course Project Getting and Cleaning Data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The variables involved in final output of this course project are as below and are a subset of the total variables included in the features.txt file provided in the original zip file. Excluding variables subjectID and activities the other variables are either a mean or standard deviation from the total 561 variables from the features.txt file

Note: Excluding subjectID and activity the variable names follow similar logic as described:
- lowecaser t or f depdning on if time or frequency of measurement
- the feature (i.e. BoddyAcc) with capital letters for the beginning of each new abbreviation (ex. **B**ody**A**cc**M**ag)
- an underscore ( _ ); This symbol is not generally used in variable names but since most of these variable names are quite long I felt this helps breks up the feature and the value 
- mean or std; each of the variable names are either a value of a mean or std from the original dataset
- lowercase axial signal (x,y,z); axial signal will not apply to all variables and in those cases do not include (x,y,z)

## Process:
**A high level view of the process of creating the final tidy datset is below. Detailed instructions and code are included in the ReadMe file**
- read in features.txt file to see whole population of variable names; file will determine how to subset for mean and std
- read in activity_labels.txt file (i.e. Walking, Sitting, etc)

**Steps below are applied to both the test and train files in the same way**
- read in subject_test.txt file and name single column "subjectID"
- read in X_test.txt file 
- subset X_test file to the columns including a value of a mean or std, determine the columns using the feature names from the feature.txt file 
- using the names() function name the variables of the subset of mean and std columns, I personally wrote out the variable names into the table but an import of the same subset of the featuers.txt file would also work (the import process will include a few other functions/steps to clean up and format the variable names)
- read in y_test.txt file and name the single column "activity"
- exchange the values in y with the corresponding activity (i.e. 1 = Walking, 2= Walking_Downstairs, etc)

**Repeat above steps for train files**
- use cbind() function to combine the test_subject, ytest, and xtest data
- use cbind() function to combine the train_subject, ytrain, and ytrain data
- use rbind() function to combine the two cbind() tables of test and train data
- install and activiate reshape2 package
- create a variable from your data set that includes the names of the columns you want to mean for the tide data set (i.e. all columns except subjectID and activity)
- use dcast function to get the mean of the features grouping by subjectID and activity

## Result: 

The above steps result in a tidy subset of the means of the features grouped by each subject and each activity
